This React application allows users to create, delete, and modify events by specifying their name, location, description, and time. The main focus of the project is to learn React Router. This includes defining routes, navigating between pages using Links, nesting routes, handling error pages for invalid or non-existent routes, defining and utilizing dynamic routes, indexing routes, and utilizing the loader() function along with the useRouteLoaderData() hook and defer.
